## Project Highlights

### Real-Time Analytics Platform

- **Objective:**  
  Developed a real-time analytics platform to process and analyze data for business intelligence applications.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  Debezium, Kafka, Python, Greenplum, Docker, Kubernetes, Graylog, Prometheus, Grafana

- **Key Achievements:**  
  - Achieved sub-second latency in capturing and processing database changes  
  - Designed and implemented scalable microservices capable of handling millions of events daily  
  - Built Grafana dashboards to monitor system performance and critical operational metrics  

### Microservices-Based Data Pipeline

- **Objective:**  
  Developed a microservices-based architecture to enable real-time streaming and processing of large datasets from multiple relational databases.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  Debezium, Kafka, Python, Docker, Kubernetes

- **Key Achievements:**  
  - Automated deployment and scaling of services using Kubernetes  
  - Reduced operational complexity by centralizing logs through Graylog containers  
  - Improved fault tolerance via Kafka partitioning and replication strategies  

### GPS Tracking & Telemetry Data Pipeline

- Designed and maintained high-performance, real-time data pipelines focused on GPS tracking systems and telemetry data ingestion.  
- Engineered solutions capable of processing hundreds of millions of records per day to support real-time analytics.  
- Leveraged cloud infrastructure, containerization, and data streaming technologies to optimize workflows for high-velocity, high-volume environments.
