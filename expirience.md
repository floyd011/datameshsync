## Professional Experience

### 1. Database Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium

- Implemented Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines using Debezium to capture real-time changes from relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.  
- Configured Debezium connectors to ensure minimal latency and high reliability in data streaming processes.  

### 2. Data Streaming with Kafka

- Designed and managed Kafka topics to support high-throughput, real-time data ingestion.  
- Ensured data consistency and fault tolerance through the implementation of robust Kafka configurations.  

### 3. Data Processing and Loading

- Developed Python-based consumers for processing Kafka streams and loading enriched data into the Greenplum analytical database.  
- Applied transformation and enrichment logic to prepare data for analytical use cases.  

### 4. Microservices Architecture

- Designed and developed modular, scalable microservices for data ingestion, transformation, and delivery.  
- Deployed microservices within a containerized environment using Docker.  
- Orchestrated containers with Kubernetes to maintain high availability and scalability of data workflows.  

### 5. Logging and Monitoring

- Centralized application logging using Logstash containers to enable real-time log tracking and diagnostics.  
- Monitored system health and performance metrics via Prometheus, with dashboards and visualizations created in Grafana.  

### 6. Data Analytics Pipeline

- Designed and optimized end-to-end pipelines capable of handling high-volume, real-time analytical workloads.  
- Ensured seamless integration between source systems, streaming platforms, and the Greenplum analytical database.
